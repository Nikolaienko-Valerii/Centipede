Player starts the game at bottom of the screen. Centipede starts moving from the top of the screen.Player goal is to destroy all centipede parts. After centipede is being hit on place where it was spawns mushroom. If head was hit next part becomes head, if middle part was hit centipede splits into two centipedes. If centipede hit player or get to the bottom of the screen - player loose one life and starts level again. If no lifes left - Game Over. On the top-left corner of the screen displayed current score and additional lifes. Player get points for destroying centipede parts and mushrooms. Each level centipede becomes shorter, but one more "head" centipede is spawned (it has greater speed). So if player is very good, after certain level there will be only "head" centipedes. Game is finished only when player lost all his lifes.
Initial mushroom field is generated randomly. After mushroom is destroyed there is small chance of "Extra life" is dropped. It will fall down and if player catches it he gets one extra life.
